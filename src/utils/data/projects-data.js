      "A comprehensive project management and bug tracking system inspired by industry-leading tools like Jira and Azure Boards. This enterprise-grade solution streamlines project workflows and bug management through an intuitive, real-time interface.",
    content: `<b>Overview</b>
<p>The <b>BugTracker</b> is a comprehensive, role-based application designed to streamline project management, bug tracking, and team collaboration. Born out of the inefficiencies of using Excel sheets for managing project requirements, feedback, and bug tickets in my previous role, this application leverages modern tools and technologies to provide a seamless, real-time experience for teams.</p>

<p>Inspired by platforms like Jira, Azure Boards, and GitLab, the BugTracker Project offers a centralized hub for creating, editing, and managing projects, bugs, and tasks, while ensuring transparency and accountability across the organization.</p>

<b class="text-2xl">üöÄ Project & Bug Management</b>  
<p>Admin users can create, edit, and delete projects, assigning each to a <b>Project Manager</b>. Bugs and tickets are linked to specific projects and assigned to developers.</p>

<b class="text-2xl">üìä Status Tracking & Automation</b>  
<p>Users update the status of their assigned tasks, and when all associated bugs/tickets are resolved, the project status is automatically updated.</p>

<b class="text-2xl">üîî Real-time Notifications</b>  
<p>Using <b>SignalR</b>, the system delivers instant notifications when new events (bugs, comments, assignments) occur. Assigned users also receive email notifications via <b>SendGrid</b> with direct links to relevant tasks.</p>

<b class="text-2xl">üìà Interactive Dashboard & Drill-Downs</b>  
<p>A company-wide dashboard provides insights into project progress, bug resolution trends, and workload distribution. Every metric has drill-down capabilities for deeper analysis.</p>

<b class="text-2xl">üîê Role-based Access Control</b>  
<p>Different user roles (Admin, Project Manager, Developer) determine permissions for creating, assigning, and managing projects and bugs. Admins can also invite new users to the system.</p>

<b class="text-2xl">üí¨ Collaboration Tools</b>  
<p>Users can comment on projects and bugs, attach relevant documents, and track discussions within the platform.</p>

<p><b>BugTracker</b> enhances efficiency by replacing outdated spreadsheet-based workflows with a dynamic, automated, and real-time issue-tracking system‚Äîbridging the gap between development teams and project management.</p>

    content: `<b>Overview</b><p><b>TechSphere</b> is a dynamic blog platform designed for developers, designers, project managers, engineers, and tech enthusiasts to discover, create, and collaborate on the latest trends in technology. From coding tips and gadget reviews to in-depth tutorials and industry insights, TechSphere serves as a hub for sharing knowledge, exploring categories, and connecting with a community of like-minded individuals shaping the future of innovation.</p><p>I created TechSphere to dive deep into the latest advancements in web development, specifically <b>Next.js 15</b> and <b>React 19</b>. The project allowed me to explore modern tools like <b>Clerk</b> for authentication and user management, including role-based access control (e.g., assigning admin roles to feature posts). Additionally, I wanted to gain hands-on experience with <b>Express 5</b> and experiment with alternatives to traditional <code>try-catch</code> error handling in the backend. TechSphere is not just a blog‚Äîit's a learning journey and a platform to empower the tech community.</p><b>Key Features</b><ul><li><b>User Authentication & Role Management</b>: Seamless authentication and user management powered by <b>Clerk</b>.
